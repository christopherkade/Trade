# Trade
A trading simulator using Algorithmic trading notions such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) in order to optimize daily benefits.

To start the simulation, use the test script like such:

./testScript MONEY

Where MONEY should be above 10000 in order to benifit from it.

This code was written by Christopher Kade for an Epitech - European Institute of Technology project.
